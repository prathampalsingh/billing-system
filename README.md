This is a simple billing system which can be changed according to your liking. 
To run this project, make sure you have installed tkinter(if not then type "pip install tkinter" terminal).
Comments are used in the code to explain where changes can be made to your liking as well as why each module is used.

this project was used as xerox billing system in my direct second year of degree in computer engineering (2022).
the ppt is present for further explaining the project through abstract,problem defination,features,etc.
This is my first github code push, thank you.
